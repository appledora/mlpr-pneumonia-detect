# mlpr-pneumonia-detect
Pneumonia is a common pulmonary disease that affects a large number of individuals worldwide, with a higher prevalence in less developed low-income regions. Chest X-ray images are a widely used diagnostic tool for the detection of pneumonia, although there is inherent variability in interpretation due to the subjective nature of visual analysis. The purpose of this research endeavor is to address this limitation by exploring automated approaches to pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images, while maintaining a high level of accuracy. I conducted a comprehensive investigation of various machine learning methods, including Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, several modified Convolutional Neural Networks, and the Vision Transformer. Moreover, I examined the utility of transfer learning techniques and assessed the performance of each of the different models. My results revealed that the proposed DenseNet model achieved an accuracy of 91.08% and an F1 score of 89.42% on the Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center dataset, indicating significant promise in this area of research.
